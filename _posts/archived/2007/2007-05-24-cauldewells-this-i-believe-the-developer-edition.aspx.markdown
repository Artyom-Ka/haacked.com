You know what I really like about [posts like
this](http://www.cauldwell.net/patrick/blog/ThisIBelieveTheDeveloperEdition.aspx "This I believe... the developer edition")?
Itâ€™s a lot less writing for me. When people ask me what principles
Subtext development tries to follow I can just point them to this post
by Patrick Cauldwell.

I need to make sure the developer guide for Subtext development includes
a link to this.
