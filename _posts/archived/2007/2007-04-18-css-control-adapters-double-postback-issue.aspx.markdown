My Coworker (and

co-admin) [Steve
Harman](http://stevenharman.net/blog/ "Steve Harman's Blog") writes
about a [weird double PostBack
issue](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/04/18/css-control-adapters-cause-double-postback-in-ie.aspx "Double Postback Issue")
he ran into recently when using CSS Friendly Control Adapters with the
CreateUserWizard Membership Provider control.

So far he hasnâ€™t received much in the way of feedback in the
[forums](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/04/18/css-control-adapters-cause-double-postback-in-ie.aspx "Forums")
yet. Have any of you run into this?
