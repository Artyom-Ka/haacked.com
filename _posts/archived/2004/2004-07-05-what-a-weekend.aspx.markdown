What a weekend in L.A! Beautiful sunny weather hovering in the mid
seventies all weekend. I played soccer on both Saturday and Sunday.
Watched Spiderman II (loved it). Had some of the best Chinese food I've
had in a long while. Found time to work on RSS Bandit. Went bodysurfing
at the beach. What more can I say? I'm a happy camper.
