My office is 17 floors up with a nice view towards the Pacific. The
ocean is a few miles away, so all I see is a sliver of blue on a clear
day.

This is not one of those days.

It looks like the sky just puked a fuzzy brownish gray blanket over the
ocean. I'm holding my breath when I go outside today.
