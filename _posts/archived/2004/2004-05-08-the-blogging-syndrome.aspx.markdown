The other day while at the gym, I started regaling my friend with a
story about my weekend trip to San Jose. Just as my storytelling juices
started to flow, he interrupts and says,

“Yeah, I know. I read it in your blog.”

“Well did I tell you that...”

“Read it.”

“How about...” I sputtered�/p\>

“Yep. That too.”

“Ok then. How many reps?”

Conversation over, we exercised in complete silence. I call this the
“Blogging Syndrome”. It’s the increasingly common situation I find
myself in where I cannot carry a conversation because the conversation
is already published on my blog for the world to see. I have nothing to
say that my friends haven't already read.

Perhaps it is time to purposely disseminate misinformation on my blog
both as conversation starters, and to reserve a few interesting stories
for me to tell via the old fashioned oral tradiion.

No matter what happens, I know I'll end up telling my friend.

“Hey, I just realized that we have nothing to talk about because of my
blog.”

Yep, I read that.
